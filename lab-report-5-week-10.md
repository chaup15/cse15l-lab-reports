# Lab Report 5 - Week 10

Hello viewer!

This will be the final lab report of the quarter. The report is about comparing two implementations of `markdown-parser` on tests that produce two different results.

To do this, I used `vimdiff` to compare the `results.txt` in my directory and in the provided directory.

## 1. [Test-file 494](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/494.md)


My implementation's result:
