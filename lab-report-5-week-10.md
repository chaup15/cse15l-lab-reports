# Lab Report 5 - Week 10

Hello viewer!

This will be the final lab report of the quarter. The report is about comparing two implementations of `markdown-parser` on tests that produce two different results.

To do this, I used `vimdiff` to compare the `results.txt` in my directory and in the provided directory.

## 1. Test-file 494
